## Prompt

```
Below I will present you a request.

Before we begin addressing the request, please answer the following pre-survey to the best of your ability.
Draw from your training knowledge AND any context provided in `.swarm/memory/*.md`.

Here is the request:

{task}

Here is the pre-survey:

  1. Please list any specific facts or figures that are GIVEN in the request itself. It is possible that there are none.
  2. Please list any facts that may need to be looked up, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found. In some cases, authoritative sources are mentioned in the request itself.
  3. Please list any facts that may need to be derived (e.g., via logical deduction, simulation, or computation).
  4. Please list any facts that are recalled from memory, hunches, well-reasoned guesses, etc.

When answering this survey, keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, statistics, etc.
Your answer should use these exact headings:

  1. GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS
  2. FACTS TO LOOK UP
  3. FACTS TO DERIVE
  4. EDUCATED GUESSES

DO NOT include any other headings or sections in your response. DO NOT list next steps or plans until asked to do so.
```

## Output schema
4 sections with the exact headings above, each followed by a bullet list (possibly empty if no facts in that category).
